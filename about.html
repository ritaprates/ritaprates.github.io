I don't know what it's like to live without them, as I've had dogs ever since my first day in the world.<br><br>I love reading and learned how to do it two weeks into 1st grade using math textbooks (go figure).<br><br>I've been dyeing my hair weird colours for five years. currently it's <span class="strikethrough">pink</span> - <span class="strikethrough">purple</span> - brown - <span class="strikethrough">peach</span> - blue - mint green. <br><br>I'm a test tube baby!<br><br>my favourite colour is pretty much every shade of blue.<br><br>I'm a devoted Nintendo fan.<br><br>I laugh a lot, and like to think of myself as friendly and easy-going.</p>

        <p> <span style="font-size:24px; color:#5EDCE1">things that really matter</span><br><br>I'm pretty good at using computer programs and take pride in it.<br><br>I'm happier when designing books and newspapers. I also enjoy designing <br>and developing websites.<br><br>my HTML and CSS skills are pretty good, but I don't know much of other languages.<br><br>branding isn't my cup of tea, mainly because I didn't do much of it at school. howeever, I'm always interested in learning!<br><br>I'm great at googling things, which makes me a somewhat independent student.<br><br>I'm only a bit shy the first time I meet you. after that I become my normal <br>outgoing self.<br><br>I love typography, wther it's type design, letterpress, or simply admiring<br> typefaces for extended periods of time.<br><br>I am fluent in portuguese and english. I can understand and communicate very easily in spanish. I can understand and read french, but producing coherent speech without help is harder.</p>
