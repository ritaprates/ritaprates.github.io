        <span style="color:#fc8f8f; font-family:'league_spartanregular'" class="underline2">pop-pop-punk</span><br><br><br>For a university project, I had to make a magazine. I wanted to explore pop-punk and what it means as a music genre, which meant making a magazine that embodied pop-punk's fun and youthful spirit. I decided to focus on the bands that are closer to the 'pop side' of pop-punk, who are sometimes seen as sell-outs because their music is catchy and they have crossed over to the 'mainstream'. The chosen bands are Green Day, blink-182, Fall Out Boy, All Time Low and 5 Seconds of Summer. <br>
I also wanted to work with newspaper, something I had never used in a project. The result is a 24-page Digital Tabloid printed by Newspaper Club that uses a four-colour palette. Between some pages there are also small notebooks that contain full colour images with lyrics from each band's music.
<br><br>The magazine contains texts from interviews and magazine articles, mostly from Kerrang!, Rocksound, Alternative Press and Rolling Stone. Next to each block of text there is a note stating its source.
The typefaces used are Campton Light and Bold, by Fontfabric, and League Gothic, by The League of Moveable Type.
